# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
ðŸ§  A deep learning-based system that detects brain tumors from MRI scans using CNNs. The model is trained with image preprocessing and data augmentation for binary classification (tumor vs. no-tumor). Built with TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV, it achieves high accuracy and aids in faster, more reliable medical diagnoses.
